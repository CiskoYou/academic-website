abstract: Cluster indices describe extremal behaviour of stationary time series. We consider runs estimators of cluster indices. Using a modern theory of multivariate, regularly varying time series, we obtain central limit theorems under conditions that can be easily verified for a large class of models. In particular, we show that blocks and runs estimators have the same limiting variance.

Using a modern theory of multivariate, regularly varying time series, we obtain central limit theorems under conditions that can be easily verified for a large class of models.
